# Vaultbeat MCP Server

**Let your own AI agent read your health data — without the cloud ever seeing it.**

> ⚠️ **Skip the `pip install vaultbeat-mcp` box PyPI puts at the top of this
> page.** Every PyPI package page gets one automatically — it isn't a
> recommendation. Use `uvx` from Quick Start below: no separate install step,
> and with `@latest` it always runs the current release. A bare `pip
> install` (or a bare `uvx` without `@latest`) gets pinned to whatever was
> current the moment you ran it and will not update itself.

This is the official local [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [Vaultbeat — AI Health Sync](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6759241985) (formerly named *Tether*), the iOS app that syncs Apple Health data (sleep, heart rate, menstrual cycle, weight, water, symptoms) between partners and to your own AI — end-to-end encrypted.

Vaultbeat embeds no AI and runs no model on your phone. Intelligence lives where you control it: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-capable agent running on your own machine. This server is the bridge — it holds a private key that never leaves your computer, pulls ciphertext from the cloud, and decrypts **only locally**.

```
iPhone (Apple Health) ──E2EE──▶ cloud (ciphertext only) ──E2EE──▶ this server (your machine) ──▶ your AI agent
```

## Requirements

- [Vaultbeat — AI Health Sync](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6759241985) on iOS, with a **Pro** subscription (the AI-agent interface is the Pro tier)
- Python 3.11+ on the machine where your agent runs (macOS / Linux / Windows)

## Quick start

### 1. Install

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended — no clone needed):

```bash
uvx vaultbeat-mcp@latest status
```

The `@latest` matters: without it, `uvx` only fetches the newest version the
*first* time you run the tool on a machine, then reuses its local cache on
every run after that — same as `pip`, which never updates once installed.
Keep `@latest` on every command below.

Or with pip (installs once, at whatever version is current right now — run
`pip install --upgrade vaultbeat-mcp` yourself to pick up new releases):

```bash
pip install 'vaultbeat-mcp[qr]'
```

> Upgrading from the old `tether-mcp` package? Same code, new name — your existing binding and config carry over unchanged. Just swap the package name in your install command and MCP client config.

### 2. Bind your phone

```bash
vaultbeat-mcp bind
```

This generates a keypair on your machine and prints a QR code. In the Vaultbeat iOS app, open **Settings → Data & AI → MCP Server** and scan it (or import a QR screenshot from Photos). The app authorizes this machine and starts sealing your health envelopes to its public key. The private key stays in `~/.tether/mcp-local/` (owner-only `0600` permissions, OS keychain where available) — it is never uploaded anywhere. (The directory keeps its original pre-rename path so existing bindings survive upgrades.)

### 3. Connect your agent

**Claude Code** (one line):

```bash
claude mcp add vaultbeat-health -- uvx vaultbeat-mcp@latest serve --transport stdio
```

**Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vaultbeat-health": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["vaultbeat-mcp@latest", "serve", "--transport", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Any other MCP client: run `vaultbeat-mcp serve --transport stdio`, or `serve --transport http` for a loopback streamable-HTTP endpoint with bearer-token auth.

> **Claude Desktop note**: it does not inherit your shell `PATH`. If `uvx` isn't found, use the absolute path (`which uvx`) as `command`.

Debugging: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx vaultbeat-mcp@latest serve --transport stdio`

Then just ask your agent: *“How did we sleep last night?”*

<!-- Keep this count in step with the table below: 19 read + 4 write + 2 bind + doctor = 26.
     The get_hrv_hourly row is a granularity argument to get_hrv, not a 27th registered tool.
     This said (16) until 2026-07-31 while the table already listed all 26 — directory listings
     render the heading, not the table, so the stale number was the public-facing one. -->
## MCP tools (26)

| Tool | Returns |
|---|---|
| `vaultbeat_status` | Local binding state (never exposes keys or tokens) |
| `vaultbeat_doctor` | Full self-diagnosis: install/binding chain **plus** which data types have data and which need a newer iOS build — call this before concluding data is missing |
| `vaultbeat_start_binding` | A fresh QR binding payload for the iOS app to scan |
| `vaultbeat_poll_binding` | One poll for the iOS authorization to complete binding |
| `vaultbeat_sync_sleep` | Recent sleep sessions incl. heart-rate samples, per-day primary-session selection matching the iOS app |
| `get_sleep_detail` | Per-night heart-rate + respiratory-rate + sleep-stage timeline |
| `get_water_intake` | Daily water intake + computed daily average |
| `get_weight_trend` | Daily weights + latest/avg/min/max + weekly trend rate, plus body composition (`body_fat_percent` 0–100, `bmi`, `lean_body_mass_kg`) when a smart scale wrote it into Apple Health |
| `get_menstrual_cycle` | Cycle samples + next-period prediction *(sensitive — explicit iOS opt-in required)* |
| `get_symptoms` | HealthKit symptom days grouped by data owner *(sensitive)* |
| `get_notes` | Free-text day annotations with their writer *(sensitive)* |
| `get_activity` | Daily activity rings: steps / energy / exercise minutes / stand hours / distance |
| `get_resting_hr` | Resting heart-rate records + window mean |
| `get_workouts` | Workout records: type / duration / calories / distance |
| `get_mindfulness` | Mindful sessions and minutes per day |
| `get_hrv` | Heart-rate variability (SDNN) records + window mean |
| `get_wrist_temp` | Sleeping wrist-temperature baseline deviation |
| `get_hrv_hourly` *(via `get_hrv(granularity="hourly")`)* | Hour-bucketed HRV averages over 30 days — the context-cheap default; `granularity="raw"` keeps minute-level spike precision |
| `get_vo2max` | VO₂ max records + latest / peak / trough / window average |
| `get_basal_energy` | Basal (resting) energy burned, per hour bucket |
| `get_total_energy_burned` | **TDEE** — basal + active per day, measured rather than estimated, with today flagged partial and excluded from the average |
| `get_strength_log` | Structured strength training: exercise, sets, reps, weight per day |
| `get_food_log` | Meals as free text with optional portions and timing |
| `log_weight_entry` | **Write** a weight entry (optionally mirrored into Apple Health when the user opts in). Carries over that day's existing body composition instead of erasing it — an agent cannot supply fat/BMI/lean mass, so a bare weight log must not wipe what the scale recorded |
| `log_strength_entry` | **Write** a strength-training entry for a given day (`merge=True` to append) |
| `log_food_entry` | **Write** a meal entry for a given day (`merge=True` to append) |
| `log_note` | **Write** a mood or general note for a given day (`merge=True` to append) |

> ⚠️ **The three `log_*` write tools replace the WHOLE DAY by default.** Passing only what you
> want to add will delete everything else recorded for that day. Pass `merge=True` to append
> instead — that is almost always what you want when adding to a day that already has data.
> Every write returns a `replaced_*` field naming exactly what it deleted, so an agent can
> notice and re-send. Since 0.2.4; before that the deletion was silent and there was no
> merge mode.

Every data tool accepts `owner` (a user-ID prefix) to filter to one person — the server may hold both your and your partner's shared records, and omitting `owner` mixes them into one pool, so per-person questions should always pass it. (Earlier releases named some tools `get_partner_*` / `tether_*`; they were renamed in the 16-tool and Vaultbeat releases.)

Reads are cache-first: decrypted records are cached locally (owner-only files, 600 s TTL, `VAULTBEAT_MCP_CACHE_TTL` to override — the pre-rename `TETHER_MCP_*` spellings still work) so repeat queries answer in ~0.2 s with zero network; pass `fresh=true` to force a cloud round trip. The same service layer backs a full CLI (`vaultbeat-mcp sleep / water / weight / …` — every data subcommand takes `--owner` too) if you prefer scripts over MCP.

## Privacy & security model

- **End-to-end encryption**: Curve25519 ECDH + HKDF-SHA256 + AES-GCM. Every health record is sealed on-device to each authorized recipient's public key (your partner, and this server once bound).
- **The cloud only ever holds ciphertext.** Vaultbeat's backend cannot read your health data — architecturally, not just by policy.
- **Decryption happens here**, on hardware you own. The private key and server token are never exposed through any tool result.
- **Sensitive kinds** (menstrual cycle, symptoms, notes) reach this server only if explicitly opted in inside the iOS app, and are never re-exported by the server.
- HTTP transport binds to loopback by default and requires a bearer token; binding a non-loopback address fails closed unless explicitly allowed — front it with TLS if you must expose it.

You can audit all of the above in this repository — that is why it is open source.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev,qr]'
